PHPSphinxQL
===========

PHP SphinxQL Library - it's used as a replacement (non-drop in replacement) for the API Sphinx Library as this builds SQL statements to send to Sphinx, it also supports multi-queries to improve speed of results (e.g. using Sphinx to generate facet's all queries can be processed together and optimised in terms of performance by Sphinx)
